In this chapter, we'll focus on how to control your own nonverbal cues during an interview. Nonverbal communication can play a significant role in how you're perceived by the interviewer, making it important to be aware of and control your own nonverbal cues.

Eye Contact
-----------

Maintaining good eye contact can demonstrate confidence, engagement, and interest in the conversation. Avoid staring, but make sure to look directly at the interviewer while they're speaking, and also while you're responding to their questions.

Posture
-------

Good posture can project confidence and professionalism. Sit up straight and avoid slouching or leaning back in your chair. This will help you appear more engaged and interested in the conversation.

Facial Expressions
------------------

Facial expressions can convey a range of emotions and attitudes. Make sure to smile when appropriate to demonstrate warmth and friendliness. Also, avoid frowning or looking bored as this can create a negative impression.

Hand Gestures
-------------

Hand gestures can be used to emphasize points and add emphasis to your speech. However, too many hand gestures can be distracting and give the impression of nervousness. Use hand gestures sparingly and naturally.

Tone of Voice
-------------

The tone of your voice can convey a lot about your attitude and emotions. Speak clearly and confidently, and try to vary your tone to convey excitement, enthusiasm, and interest in the position.

Conclusion
----------

Controlling your own nonverbal cues during an interview is an important part of creating a positive impression. Remember to maintain good eye contact, sit up straight, smile, use hand gestures sparingly, and vary your tone of voice. By mastering these techniques, you can ensure that your nonverbal communication is working in your favor during the interview process.
