* **Practice:** Practice answering common interview questions and conducting mock interviews. This helps you refine your responses and increase your comfort with the process.

* **Body Language:** Maintain strong, positive body language during the interview. Make eye contact, offer a firm handshake, and sit or stand with good posture to project confidence.

* **Self-Care:** Prioritize self-care to manage anxiety and stress. Exercise, eat well, and get enough sleep to ensure you're physically and mentally prepared.
