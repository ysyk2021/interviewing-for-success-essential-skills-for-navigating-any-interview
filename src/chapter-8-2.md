Strategies for Staying Top-of-Mind with Hiring Managers
====================================================================================================

Following up after an interview is just one way to stay top-of-mind with hiring managers, but it's not the only way. In this chapter, we'll cover strategies for staying in touch with hiring managers and keeping your candidacy front and center.

Connect on LinkedIn
-------------------

Connecting with the hiring manager or recruiter on LinkedIn can be a great way to stay in touch and keep your candidacy fresh in their minds. Make sure to personalize your connection request and reference your conversation during the interview. You can also use LinkedIn to share relevant articles or industry news that may be of interest to the interviewer.

Send Updates on Relevant Projects
---------------------------------

If you're still in the running for the position, sending updates on relevant projects or accomplishments can help demonstrate your skills and expertise. For example, if you just completed a project that demonstrates your ability to lead a team or solve a complex problem, send a brief update to the hiring manager highlighting your success.

Invite Them to Coffee
---------------------

If you're still interested in the position and want to continue building a relationship with the hiring manager, consider inviting them to coffee. This can be a great opportunity to learn more about the company culture and discuss how you can add value to the organization. Make sure to come prepared with thoughtful questions and ideas for how you can contribute to the team.

Attend Networking Events
------------------------

Attending networking events related to your industry or field can also be a way to stay top-of-mind with hiring managers. If you know that the hiring manager or recruiter will be attending an event, make sure to introduce yourself and have a brief conversation about your candidacy. Even if they're not able to hire you for the current position, they may keep you in mind for future opportunities.

Send Personalized Follow-Up Emails
----------------------------------

Sending personalized follow-up emails to the hiring manager or recruiter can also be an effective way to stay in touch and demonstrate your continued interest in the position. Make sure to reference specific aspects of your conversation during the interview and highlight why you're still interested in the role.

Conclusion
----------

Staying top-of-mind with hiring managers requires a thoughtful and strategic approach. By connecting on LinkedIn, sending updates on relevant projects, inviting them to coffee, attending networking events, and sending personalized follow-up emails, you can demonstrate your professionalism and keep your candidacy fresh in their minds. Remember to stay engaged and authentic throughout the process.
