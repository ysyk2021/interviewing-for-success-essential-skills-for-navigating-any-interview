Preparing for Phone and Video Interviews

Preparing for phone and video interviews requires some additional considerations beyond in-person interviews. Consider the following strategies:

Using effective communication and technology skills is essential for a successful phone or video interview. Consider the following strategies:

* Speak clearly and concisely, and avoid interrupting the interviewer.
* Use active listening skills to show that you're engaged in the conversation.
* Make eye contact with the camera (for video interviews) to establish a connection with the interviewer.

By using effective communication and technology skills, you can make a positive impression and demonstrate your abilities even in a non-traditional interview setting.

Following Up Appropriately

Following up appropriately after a phone or video interview is just as important as after an in-person interview. Consider the following strategies:

* Send a thank-you note or email within 24 hours of the interview.
* Reference specific details from the interview to demonstrate your engagement and interest.
