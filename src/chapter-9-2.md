Group Interviews
=======================================================================

In this chapter, we'll cover strategies for navigating group interviews. Group interviews can be intimidating, but they also provide an opportunity to demonstrate your communication and collaboration skills.

Introduce Yourself to the Other Candidates
------------------------------------------

When you first arrive at the group interview, take the initiative to introduce yourself to the other candidates. This demonstrates your confidence and social skills, and helps establish a positive rapport with the other candidates.

Listen Actively to What Others Are Saying
-----------------------------------------

During the group interview, listen actively to what others are saying and build on their ideas. This demonstrates your ability to work collaboratively and shows that you value the input of others.

Speak Clearly and Confidently
-----------------------------

When it's your turn to speak, speak clearly and confidently. Use eye contact and engage with the other candidates and the interviewer. Avoid interrupting others or dominating the conversation.

Follow Up with a Thank-You Note or Email
----------------------------------------

After the group interview, follow up with a thank-you note or email. Use this opportunity to reiterate your interest in the position and highlight specific aspects of the interview that stood out to you. If possible, personalize the note to each interviewer to demonstrate your attention to detail.
